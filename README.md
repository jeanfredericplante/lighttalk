# Light Talk - Small talk with light

iPhone app using the flashlight to broadcast messages (possibly secretely) between iphones. This would be the ultimate secrecy since no network is needed.
I have left this project aside as I am focusing on other side projects but feel free to reach if you'd be interested in participating/reigniting this.

## Current status
- Multi-flashlevel encoder with sync header and CRC
- Sending message via Flash and receiving raw image
- in-progress decoding (see matlab file for wip processing)

## Example of raw reading
